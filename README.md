# Purpose of Application
The purpose of this application was to create a customizable simple work day planner. The user can quickly see what time-block they are currently in and what needs to be done within the hour. With the use of local storage, the page will save the user's input data and present it whenever the page is reloaded. 

# My Experience
I enjoyed this project throughly. It challenged me enough with using local storage and incorporating moment.js within javascript. I felt like this was managable since I pseudo coded my javascript first. Once I understood the logic behind it all, it was simply piecing everything together.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
